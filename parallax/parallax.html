  <h1>Bucket List Travel</h1>
  <p>Travel should be meaningful. It should excite and inspire you, rejuvenate and ground you, educate and challenge you, and most of all, it should humble you. Travel gives us our greatest stories, our most cherished memories and countless irreplaceable learnings that we can choose to pay forward to others. It teaches us about ourselves and each other, it broadens our horizons and, just like a reset button, it forces us to refocus on what really matters.</p>

<h1>London</h1>
  <p>London is a fantastic place to visit, especially thanks to England's excellent public transit. You could easily spend a week or more experiencing everything that each London area has to offer, and still have money left over for your next trip.</p>

<h1>Paris</h1>
  <p>Paris is unlike any other city in the world. It's brimming with culture, history, and natural beauty. While many visitors come to Paris to see the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, or Notre-Dame, the real magic is found in the streets. A journey to Paris would be a once in a lifetime experience.</p>

<h1>Tokyo</h1>
  <p>The city of Tokyo is the world's most populous. Because English is not widely spoken, globalization's impact is limited. It's a breath of fresh air amid the many destinations that have become lost in their efforts to pander to tourists and achieve global standards.</p>

<h1>Barcelona</h1>
  <p>Barcelona is an energetic social blend with amazingly popular cooking, extraordinary workmanship, music, and then some. At the point when you visit this radiant city, you'll go through your days going around the energetic barrios, walking around the ocean side, walking around rich green spaces, and finding many more than one jewel some notable, like Park GÃ¼ell or Camp Nou, and others dark, like Santa Caterina.</p>

<h1>Dubai</h1>
  <p>Dubai is loaded with contrasts. There's the sparkling horizon, consisting of high rises so tall they oppose creative minds; the advanced assortment of stores and diners, presenting each sort of choice an explorer might actually need; and the extravagant inns, prepared to welcome even the most insightful voyager in style and overabundance.</p>

<h1>Bali</h1>
  <p>The most fulfilling and exciting Bali vacations include several places, so you don't have to worry about choosing just one atmosphere or scene. If you don't have enough time, it's best to combine some or two. It doesn't make sense to rush to a temple tour, taste experience, yoga session, shopping, or Balinese massage. Enjoy your time on the island  and the  overwhelmingly generous, sweet and authentic locals. Taking all the factors into account, Bali feels much better, happier, healthier, and arguably almost impossible to stay tanned than when landing.</p>

<h1>Florence</h1>
  <p>This is a city surrounded by nature like no other. Cross the Ponte Vecchio and the river Arno to reach the Ortoralno district, with its cobblestone squares, cozy cafes and centuries-old craftsmen. Take a walk along the riverbank, explore the exquisite Renaissance gardens, or meander through cypress-covered hills. Every turn, you get a spectacular view of the city and its huge terracotta dome, as opposed to the mountains in the distance. In Florence, even  landscape is an art.</p>
